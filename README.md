# bugged
just a test for bugged launcher
the source code will be here in a few day (i am fixing some issue)
# note
note that the website and the launcher are open source
but not the game   
you are free to reuse the launcher just make sure to change parameter
(e.g game id ,itch.io api key,launcher name)
the launcher currently support only one game at time so if you have multiple game you have to make one launcher for each (with different game else i will corrupt the appdata older of the launcher)
